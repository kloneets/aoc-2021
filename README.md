# Advent of code 2021

## 1 day
Out of lack of time, first one I did in PHP (I know it better)
```sh
cd adv1

# run with php-cli
# firs part
php result.php

# second part
php result2.php
```

## 2 day
I want to learn rust, so there is a bit of lame code, unnecessary copy/paste etc.
```sh
cd adv2
cargo run
```

## 3 day
Continuing with rust
```sh
cd adv3
cargo run
```
