# Advent of code 2021
Annual [Advent Of code (2021)](https://https://adventofcode.com/2021)

## 1 day
Out of lack of time, first one I did in PHP (I know it better)
```sh
cd adv1

# run with php-cli
# firs part
php result.php

# second part
php result2.php
```

## 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 day
I want to learn rust, so there is a bit of lame code, unnecessary copy/paste etc.
```sh
# replace 2 with day you desire to run
cd adv2
cargo run
```
